# Platform Mapping Configuration
# Primary method: Edit platform_maps.json in project root (recommended)
# Override method: Use CUSTOM_MAPS environment variable (highest priority)
#
# The platform_maps.json file contains all default platform mappings.
# Edit it directly to customize how RomM platform slugs map to your filesystem directories.
#
# CUSTOM_MAPS environment variable (optional):
# For temporary or environment-specific overrides, use this variable.
# It takes precedence over platform_maps.json settings.
# Example: CUSTOM_MAPS='{"ps": "psx", "ngc": "gamecube"}'
# CUSTOM_MAPS=''
